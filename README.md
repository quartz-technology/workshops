## Introduction

This repository contains the subjects and corrections for the workshops written by us, the folks at Quartz Technology.
We wanted to share our knowledge with everyone on the topics we love.

A workshop is divided in several steps and assumes that you are autonomous enough to take a look at the resources we provide if you need help.
A correction is available, so that you may compare your implementation with our.

With that said, be curious and good luck !

## Content

As we worked on the workshops available at [PoC Innovation](https://github.com/PoCInnovation/Workshops), the organization is almost the same, with the workshops being scattered across high-level topics:

- 🔐 [**Cybersecurity**](./cybersecurity/README.md)
- 💻 [**Software**](./software/README.md)
- 🐙 [**DevOps**](./devops/README.md)
